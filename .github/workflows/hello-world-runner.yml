# HELLO WORLD SELF-HOSTED RUNNER TEST 
# ===================================================
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Understand how to target self-hosted runners
# - Learn how to verify runner functionality
# - See basic environment information retrieval
# - Experience the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners
# ===================================================

name: Hello World Self-Hosted Runner

# LEARNING POINT: Multiple trigger types for flexibility
on:
  # Manual trigger from GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:
  
  # Automatic trigger on push to main branch
  # Uncomment push trigger when using it
  # push:
  #   branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # LEARNING POINT: Simple job targeting self-hosted runner
  hello-world:
    # LEARNING POINT: This is how you specify a self-hosted runner
    # Instead of ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, etc.
    runs-on: self-hosted
    
    steps:
      # LEARNING POINT: Standard checkout action works on self-hosted runners too
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # LEARNING POINT: Basic hello world with runner information
      - name: Hello from self-hosted runner
        run: |
          echo "========================================"
          echo "üëã Hello, World! I'm a self-hosted runner!"
          echo "========================================"
          echo "üè∑Ô∏è Runner name: ${{ runner.name }}"
          echo "üíª Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
          echo "üìÇ Working directory: $(pwd)"
          echo "üì¶ Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
          echo "üîÑ Workflow: ${{ github.workflow }}"
      
      # LEARNING POINT: Simple system information for verification
      - name: Basic system info
        run: |
          echo "========================================"
          echo "üìä System Information"
          echo "========================================"
          echo "üñ•Ô∏è Hostname: $(hostname)"
          echo "üíæ Disk space:"
          df -h / | grep -v Filesystem
          
          # Show that we're running on the self-hosted machine
          echo "üåê IP Address:"
          hostname -I || echo "IP address command not available"

# ===================================================
# LEARNING NOTES:
# ===================================================
# 1. Self-hosted runners are specified with "runs-on: self-hosted"
# 2. You can add labels to runners and target them with:
#    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, production]
# 3. Self-hosted runners have access to their host environment
# 4. You can install custom software on self-hosted runners
# 5. Self-hosted runners can access internal networks
